# Colvert

## Node converter for my hexcol minetest mod

If you were using the old version of hexcol and you update to the new one, the old nodes will all become unknown nodes.

This simple mod helps by providing a convert command to convert the old nodes to the new ones.

Just use `/colvert <radius>` to do the conversion on nearby nodes.
